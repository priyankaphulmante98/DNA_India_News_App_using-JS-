            discription:"According to scientists and researchers, a solar storm of significant size is expected to hit the Earth today, July 20, and is likely to cause a few outages in prone areas. The solar storm is caused by a solar flare that emerged from the Sun around July 15.The solar flare is now expected to hit Earth today, causing a massive solar storm that can disrupt services across the globe. Scientists have said that the solar storm can be of G-2 or G-3 level and can cause disruption of GPS navigation and radio services.Renowned physicist Dr Tamitha Skov raised the alert for the solar storm hitting Earth on social media a few days back, saying that GPS, as well as flight and ship travel, can be disrupted due to a potential global outage of services.Taking to Twitter, the physicist had said, “The long snake-like filament cartwheeled its way off the Sun in a stunning ballet. The magnetic orientation of this Earth-directed solar storm is going to be tough to predict. G2-level (possibly G3) conditions may occur if the magnetic field of this storm is oriented southward!”Experts have said that if the solar storm reaches a massive level, it can cause outages and blackouts across the globe on July 20. Earlier, it was predicted that the solar flare will hit the Earth with a storm on July 18, but the date was later pushed.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicted that new sunspots are expected to appear on the Earth soon, with the likelihood of solar flares, which can be as strong as X category.As per the definition of the phenomenon, a solar flare is an intense localized eruption of electromagnetic radiation in the Sun's atmosphere. A solar flare can be classified into five major categories – A, B, C, M, and X – with X being the one with the highest intensity.GPS users in prone areas have been asked to stay on alert as the massive solar storm can disrupt communication and navigation systems.

            discription:"Former Indian skipper Virat Kohli's stint as captain ended earlier this year as Rohit Sharma replaced Kohli as the full-time captain in ODI and Test formats. The Delhi-born batsman had earlier relinquished T20I captaincy, following the ICC T20I World Cup.Despite having had his fair share of successes across formats, Kohli's biggest regret would be that he could never win an ICC trophy as India's captain. Having led the Men in Blue in three ICC tournaments, after taking over from the legendary MS Dhoni, Kohli could never inspire his side to an ICC title. The closest India got to winning an ICC title under Kohli was back in 2017, when they were thrashed by arch-rivals Pakistan in the final of the ICC Champions Trophy. Later in the 2019 ODI World Cup, India had a splendid run to the semifinal, but fell short by 18 runs and were knocked out of the semis by New Zealand. READ| Virat Kohli likely to feature in ODI series against Zimbabwe for first time in his careerDuring the ICC 2021 T20 World Cup, India failed to qualify for the knockout rounds, which proved to be a sad ending to Kohli's captaincy stint in the T20I format. Although, in a recent interview with CricChat on the ShareChat Audio Chatroom, former Indian pacer S Sreesanth claimed that he could have helped Kohli lift three World Cups if he had been part of the Indian team. If I would have been a part of the team under Virat’s captaincy, India would have won the World Cup in 2015, 2019 & 2021, he stated, even though it wasn't Kohli who led India at the ICC ODI World Cup, instead it was MS Dhoni.
