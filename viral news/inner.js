Even if it is only for a short time, the happiness remains. A similar scenario happened with these Bengaluru youngsters. The Bengaluru South East Division Police granted their demand to become police officers. The touching story and the motive for such an action have already made netizens teary-eyed.Two boys namely Mohammad Salman from Kerala & Mithilesh from Bengaluru are battling cancer. They wish to become police officers and their wish fell to the ears of the Bengaluru South East Division Police who organised a special moment for the boys.The Bengaluru South East Division Police Department fulfilled their wish by appointing them as DCPs (Deputy Police Commissioners) for a few hours. The little lads got to wear the outfit and sit in the DCP's office.A post regarding the same was shared by Deputy Commissioner of Police, South-East Division CK Baba on Twitter. A humbling day as I stood at attention to DCPs for the day. Courageous children, who are fighting a difficult disease and we played a small part in making their wish come true, albeit for a few hours only. Happiness unlimited for them and satisfaction for us, reads the caption of the post."
